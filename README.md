# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to use a credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a lending services company, to oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. A combination approach was also utilized to over- and undersample using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Lastly, two machine learning models were used that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Six different machine learning models were imported to evaluate the the credit card dataset for credit risk, and determine the best machine learning model to predict credit risk.

## Results:
